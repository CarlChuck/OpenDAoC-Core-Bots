### Coverage Statistics
- **Total SRD Documents**: 145
- **Documents with Game Rule Summaries**: 20 (13.8%)
- **Remaining Documents**: 125

## What Game Rule Summaries Accomplish

Game rule summaries transform technical documentation like this:
```
BaseEvade = ((Dex + Qui) / 2 - 50) * 0.05 + EvadeAbilityLevel * 5
```

Into accessible explanations like this:
```
**Game Rule Summary**: Evade is your ability to dodge out of the way of attacks through speed and agility. Fast, agile characters are much better at evading than slow, clumsy ones. You can't evade attacks from behind unless you have special training.
```

## Priority Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Core Combat (Priority 1) âœ… COMPLETE
All systems that affect every combat interaction are now complete with game rule summaries.

### Phase 2: Character Development (Priority 2) âœ… COMPLETE  
All essential character progression systems now have comprehensive game rule summaries explaining:
- How classes work and their differences
- Specialization point allocation and training
- Realm vs Realm progression and abilities
- Master Level endgame content and themes
- Champion Level alternative progression

### Phase 3: Magic Systems (Priority 3) âœ… COMPLETE
Critical magic mechanics now have comprehensive game rule summaries:

1. **Spell_Mechanics.md** âœ… - Core spell mechanics, hit chances, damage calculation
2. **Casting_Mechanics_System.md** âœ… - Cast time, power costs, interruption, concentration  
3. **Spell_Effects_System.md** âœ… - Effect stacking, duration, immunity, effectiveness
4. **Buff_Effect_System.md** âœ… - Buff/debuff mechanics, categories, disabled effects

### Current Completion Status: 17 out of 145 documents (11.7%)

All three priority phases covering the foundational systems are now complete:
- **Combat Systems**: Complete coverage of attack resolution, damage, defense, styles, speed, criticals, resistance
- **Character Development**: Complete coverage of classes, specialization, realm ranks, master levels, champion levels  
- **Magic Systems**: Complete coverage of spell mechanics, casting, effects, and buff stacking

### Next Priority Areas ðŸŽ¯

**Phase 4: Item Systems (Priority 4)**
Essential for equipment and loot mechanics:

1. **Item_Mechanics_System.md** - Core item properties and functionality
2. **Equipment_Slots_System.md** - Equipment management and restrictions
3. **Item_Generation_System.md** - Random and unique item creation
4. **Durability_Repair_System.md** - Item condition and maintenance
5. **Artifact_System.md** - Artifact mechanics and progression

## Game Rule Summary Template

For each major section, add this format:

```markdown
### Section Name

**Game Rule Summary**: [1-3 sentences explaining what this means to a player in simple terms. Focus on the practical impact and why it matters for gameplay. Avoid technical jargon.]

[Existing technical content remains unchanged...]
```

## Example Summaries by Topic

### Combat Examples:
- **Attack Resolution**: "When you attack someone, the game checks various defenses in order. Only the first successful defense stops the attack - you can't stack multiple defenses."

- **Style Mechanics**: "Combat styles are special attacks that do extra damage when used in the right situation. Some require hitting from behind, others work after your enemy blocks you. Mastering style chains separates good fighters from great ones."

- **Defense Mechanics**: "You have three ways to avoid damage: dodge (evade), deflect with weapon (parry), or stop with shield (block). Fighting multiple enemies makes all defenses less effective."

### Character Examples:
- **Specialization**: "Specialization points let you focus your character's training. Pure fighters get fewer points but use them more efficiently, while versatile classes get more points spread across many skills."

- **Class System**: "Each class has strengths and weaknesses designed for different roles. Heavy fighters excel in direct combat, sneaky classes strike from shadows, and casters control the battlefield with magic."

### Magic Examples:
- **Spell Mechanics**: "Spells can miss and be resisted just like weapon attacks. Higher skill makes spells more reliable, and different resistances protect against different magic types."

- **Buff Stacking**: "Only the strongest version of each type of magical enhancement affects you. You can't stack multiple strength buffs, but you can have strength, dexterity, and armor buffs all at once."

## Implementation Guidelines

### Writing Style:
- **Audience**: New players learning the game
- **Tone**: Conversational but informative
- **Length**: 1-3 sentences per summary
- **Focus**: What players experience, not how code works

### Content Focus:
- **Why it matters** to gameplay
- **When players encounter it**
- **How it affects their decisions**
- **What makes it unique to DAoC**

### Avoid:
- Programming terminology
- Variable names or code references
- Complex mathematical formulas in summaries
- Implementation details

## Quality Checklist

For each game rule summary, verify:
- [ ] Can a new player understand it?
- [ ] Does it explain the gameplay impact?
- [ ] Is it free of technical jargon?
- [ ] Does it connect to player experience?
- [ ] Is it concise but complete?

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Phase 1** - The 5 remaining core combat documents
2. **Validate approach** - Ensure summaries are effective
3. **Continue with Phase 2** - Character progression systems
4. **Expand to all systems** - Complete the remaining 137+ documents

## Success Metrics

- Players can understand game mechanics without programming background
- Game designers can quickly grasp system purposes  
- New developers understand game rules before diving into code
- Documentation serves both technical and gameplay audiences

## Long-term Vision

The completed SRD will serve as:
- **Player Reference** - Understanding game mechanics
- **Designer Guide** - Game rule documentation
- **Developer Onboarding** - Learning existing systems
- **QA Resource** - Validating correct behavior
- **Community Documentation** - Explaining DAoC's depth

This initiative transforms the SRD from purely technical documentation into a comprehensive game design reference that serves multiple audiences while preserving all technical detail.
