# Command System

## Document Status
- **Last Updated**: 2024-01-20
- **Verification**: Code-verified from ScriptMgr.cs, AbstractCommandHandler.cs, CmdAttribute.cs
- **Implementation Status**: âœ… Fully Implemented

## Overview

**Game Rule Summary**: The command system is how you interact with the game through typed commands that start with a slash (/). Every player can use basic commands like `/say` to talk, `/who` to see who's online, or `/quit` to leave the game. Game Masters and Administrators have access to additional powerful commands for managing the game world and helping players. Commands are automatically protected against spam and have built-in help systems to show you how to use them properly.

The Command System provides a flexible framework for handling slash commands with privilege level enforcement, spam protection, and automatic command discovery. It supports player commands, GM commands, and admin commands with comprehensive help and syntax validation.

## Core Architecture

### Command Attributes

**Game Rule Summary**: Commands are organized by privilege level - what you can access depends on whether you're a regular player, Game Master, or Administrator. Each command has built-in help text that explains what it does and how to use it. The system automatically prevents you from using commands you don't have permission for.

Commands are registered using attributes that define their properties:

```csharp
[CmdAttribute(
    "&player",           // Command trigger
    ePrivLevel.GM,       // Minimum privilege level
    "Various Admin/GM commands to edit characters.",  // Description
    "/player name <newName>",     // Usage examples
    "/player level <newLevel>",
    "/player realm <newRealm>"
)]
public class PlayerCommandHandler : AbstractCommandHandler, ICommandHandler
{
    public void OnCommand(GameClient client, string[] args)
    {
        // Command implementation
    }
}
```

### Command Attribute Variants
```csharp
// Basic command
[CmdAttribute("&sit", ePrivLevel.Player, "Sit", "/sit")]

// Command with aliases
[CmdAttribute("&guild", new string[] {"&gu"}, ePrivLevel.Player, "Guild Chat", "/gu <text>")]

// Command with header (for complex command groups)
[CmdAttribute("&plvl", "AdminCommands.Header.Syntax.Plvl", ePrivLevel.Admin, 
    "AdminCommands.Plvl.Description", 
    "AdminCommands.Plvl.Syntax.Comm",
    "AdminCommands.Plvl.Usage.Comm")]
```

### Privilege Levels

**Game Rule Summary**: There are three main levels of access in the game. Regular players (Level 1) can use basic social and gameplay commands. Game Masters (Level 2) can help other players and manage NPCs and events. Administrators (Level 3) have full control over the server and can manage accounts and system settings. You can't use commands above your privilege level.

```csharp
public enum ePrivLevel : uint
{
    Player = 1,  // Normal players
    GM = 2,      // Game Masters
    Admin = 3    // Administrators
}
```

### Command Handler Interface

**Game Rule Summary**: All commands include spam protection to prevent flooding the chat with repeated commands. Most commands have a half-second delay between uses, though Game Masters and Administrators can bypass these restrictions when needed for their duties.

```csharp
public interface ICommandHandler
{
    void OnCommand(GameClient client, string[] args);
}

public abstract class AbstractCommandHandler
{
    // Spam protection
    public static bool IsSpammingCommand(GamePlayer player, string commandName);
    public static bool IsSpammingCommand(GamePlayer player, string commandName, int delay);
    
    // Message display helpers
    public virtual void DisplayMessage(GameClient client, string message);
    public virtual void DisplaySyntax(GameClient client);
}
```

## Command Discovery and Registration

### Automatic Registration

**Game Rule Summary**: The game automatically discovers and loads all available commands when the server starts. You don't need to manually register new commands - they're detected and made available as soon as the server loads them.

```csharp
public static bool LoadCommands()
{
    foreach (Assembly assembly in ScriptMgr.Scripts)
    {
        foreach (Type type in assembly.GetTypes())
        {
            if (!type.IsClass || type.IsAbstract)
                continue;
                
            foreach (CmdAttribute attrib in type.GetCustomAttributes<CmdAttribute>(false))
            {
                var cmd = new GameCommand();
                cmd.Usage = attrib.Usage;
                cmd.m_cmd = attrib.Cmd;
                cmd.m_lvl = attrib.Level;
                cmd.m_desc = attrib.Description;
                cmd.m_cmdHandler = (ICommandHandler)Activator.CreateInstance(type);
                m_gameCommands.Add(attrib.Cmd, cmd);
                
                // Register aliases
                if (attrib.Aliases != null)
                {
                    foreach (string alias in attrib.Aliases)
                    {
                        m_gameCommands.Add(alias, cmd);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Command Guessing

**Game Rule Summary**: You don't have to type complete command names. If you type `/who` it works, but you can also just type `/wh` if there's no other command that starts with those letters. The system will find the command you meant and execute it, making commands faster and easier to use.

```csharp
public static GameCommand GuessCommand(string cmd)
{
    // Exact match first
    if (m_gameCommands.TryGetValue(cmd, out GameCommand command))
        return command;
        
    // Partial match
    string cmdToLower = cmd.ToLower();
    foreach (var kvp in m_gameCommands)
    {
        if (kvp.Key.ToLower().StartsWith(cmdToLower))
            return kvp.Value;
    }
    
    return null;
}
```

## Command Processing

### Command Parsing

**Game Rule Summary**: Commands can handle complex arguments including quoted text. If you need to include spaces in a command argument, just put quotes around it. For example, `/tell "Player Name" hello there` will work even if the player's name has spaces.

```csharp
public static string[] ParseCmdLine(string cmdLine)
{
    var args = new ArrayList();
    bool inQuotes = false;
    var arg = new StringBuilder();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < cmdLine.Length; i++)
    {
        char c = cmdLine[i];
        
        if (c == '"')
        {
            inQuotes = !inQuotes;
        }
        else if (c == ' ' && !inQuotes)
        {
            if (arg.Length > 0)
            {
                args.Add(arg.ToString());
                arg.Clear();
            }
        }
        else
        {
            arg.Append(c);
        }
    }
    
    if (arg.Length > 0)
        args.Add(arg.ToString());
        
    return (string[])args.ToArray(typeof(string));
}
```

### Permission Checking

**Game Rule Summary**: When you try to use a command, the system first checks if you have the right privilege level. If you don't have access, it acts like the command doesn't exist rather than telling you it's forbidden. This prevents players from discovering admin commands by trial and error.

```csharp
public static bool HandleCommand(GameClient client, string cmdLine)
{
    string[] pars = ParseCmdLine(cmdLine);
    GameCommand myCommand = GuessCommand(pars[0]);
    
    if (myCommand == null) 
        return false;
        
    // Check privilege level
    if (client.Account.PrivLevel < myCommand.m_lvl)
    {
        // Check single permission system
        if (!SinglePermission.HasPermission(client.Player, pars[0].Substring(1)))
        {
            client.Out.SendMessage("No such command (" + pars[0] + ")", 
                eChatType.CT_System, eChatLoc.CL_SystemWindow);
            return true;
        }
    }
    
    ExecuteCommand(client, myCommand, pars);
    return true;
}
```

### Command Execution

**Game Rule Summary**: All GM and Admin commands are automatically logged for security and auditing purposes. This helps track what staff members are doing and can help diagnose problems or investigate issues. Regular player commands are not logged to preserve privacy.

```csharp
private static void ExecuteCommand(GameClient client, GameCommand myCommand, string[] pars)
{
    // Log command usage
    if (client.Account == null || 
        ((ServerProperties.Properties.LOG_ALL_GM_COMMANDS && client.Account.PrivLevel > 1) || 
         myCommand.m_lvl > 1))
    {
        string commandText = String.Join(" ", pars);
        string targetName = client.Player?.TargetObject?.Name ?? "(no target)";
        string playerName = client.Player?.Name ?? "(player is null)";
        string accountName = client.Account?.Name ?? "account is null";
        
        AuditMgr.LogGMCommand(commandText, playerName, targetName, accountName);
    }
    
    // Execute the command
    myCommand.m_cmdHandler.OnCommand(client, pars);
}
```

## Spam Protection

### Command Spam Detection

**Game Rule Summary**: To prevent spam and flooding, most commands have a built-in delay between uses. Regular players must wait about half a second between commands, but Game Masters and Administrators can bypass this restriction when they need to perform their duties quickly.

```csharp
public static bool IsSpammingCommand(GamePlayer player, string commandName, int delay = 500)
{
    // GMs and Admins bypass spam protection
    if ((ePrivLevel)player.Client.Account.PrivLevel > ePrivLevel.Player)
        return false;
        
    string spamKey = commandName + "NOSPAM";
    long tick = player.TempProperties.GetProperty<long>(spamKey);
    
    if (tick > 0 && player.CurrentRegion.Time - tick <= 0)
    {
        player.TempProperties.RemoveProperty(spamKey);
    }
    
    long changeTime = player.CurrentRegion.Time - tick;
    
    if (tick > 0 && changeTime < delay)
    {
        return true; // Still in spam delay
    }
    
    player.TempProperties.SetProperty(spamKey, player.CurrentRegion.Time);
    return false;
}
```

### Default Spam Delays
```ini
# Server Properties
COMMAND_SPAM_DELAY = 500  # Default 500ms between commands
```

## Command Categories

### Player Commands

**Game Rule Summary**: Every player has access to dozens of basic commands for communication, information, and gameplay. You can talk in various channels, check game status, manage your character, and interact socially with other players. These commands cover everything you need for normal gameplay.

Available to all players (ePrivLevel.Player):

```csharp
// Basic actions
[CmdAttribute("&sit", ePrivLevel.Player, "Sit", "/sit")]
[CmdAttribute("&stand", ePrivLevel.Player, "Stand up", "/stand")]
[CmdAttribute("&quit", ePrivLevel.Player, "Quit the game", "/quit")]

// Communication
[CmdAttribute("&say", ePrivLevel.Player, "Say something", "/say <message>")]
[CmdAttribute("&guild", new string[] {"&gu"}, ePrivLevel.Player, "Guild chat", "/gu <text>")]
[CmdAttribute("&group", new string[] {"&g"}, ePrivLevel.Player, "Group chat", "/g <text>")]

// Information
[CmdAttribute("&who", ePrivLevel.Player, "List online players", "/who [filter]")]
[CmdAttribute("&time", ePrivLevel.Player, "Show game time", "/time")]
[CmdAttribute("&stats", ePrivLevel.Player, "Show statistics", "/stats")]

// Social
[CmdAttribute("&anonymous", new string[] {"&anon"}, ePrivLevel.Player, "Toggle anonymous mode", "/anon")]
[CmdAttribute("&afk", ePrivLevel.Player, "Set AFK message", "/afk [message]")]
[CmdAttribute("&friend", ePrivLevel.Player, "Manage friends", "/friend <add|remove|list> [name]")]

// Housing
[CmdAttribute("&house", ePrivLevel.Player, "House commands", "/house")]
```

### GM Commands

**Game Rule Summary**: Game Masters get access to additional commands for helping players and managing game events. They can modify player characters, create items and NPCs, teleport around the world, and control various game systems. These commands are meant for customer service and event management.

Available to Game Masters (ePrivLevel.GM):

```csharp
// Player management
[CmdAttribute("&player", ePrivLevel.GM, "Edit players", "/player <property> <value>")]
[CmdAttribute("&mute", ePrivLevel.GM, "Mute players", "/mute <player> [duration]")]
[CmdAttribute("&kick", ePrivLevel.GM, "Kick players", "/kick <player>")]

// Object creation
[CmdAttribute("&create", ePrivLevel.GM, "Create objects", "/create <type> [params]")]
[CmdAttribute("&mob", ePrivLevel.GM, "Create NPCs", "/mob create <mobID>")]
[CmdAttribute("&item", ePrivLevel.GM, "Create items", "/item create <itemID>")]

// World manipulation
[CmdAttribute("&gmstealth", ePrivLevel.GM, "GM stealth", "/gmstealth <on|off>")]
[CmdAttribute("&jump", ePrivLevel.GM, "Teleport", "/jump <player|location>")]
[CmdAttribute("&summon", ePrivLevel.GM, "Summon player", "/summon <player>")]

// Information
[CmdAttribute("&gmappeal", new string[] {"&gmhelp"}, ePrivLevel.GM, "Manage appeals", "/gmappeal <command>")]
[CmdAttribute("&weather", ePrivLevel.GM, "Control weather", "/weather <start|stop|info>")]
```

### Admin Commands

**Game Rule Summary**: Administrators have the most powerful commands for managing the entire server. They can shut down the server, manage player accounts, broadcast messages to everyone, and modify core game settings. These commands can affect the entire game world and all players.

Available to Administrators (ePrivLevel.Admin):

```csharp
// Server management
[CmdAttribute("&shutdown", ePrivLevel.Admin, "Shutdown server", "/shutdown [time] [message]")]
[CmdAttribute("&broadcast", ePrivLevel.Admin, "Server broadcast", "/broadcast <message>")]
[CmdAttribute("&serverproperties", ePrivLevel.Admin, "Manage properties", "/serverproperties <command>")]

// Account management
[CmdAttribute("&account", ePrivLevel.Admin, "Manage accounts", "/account <command> [params]")]
[CmdAttribute("&plvl", ePrivLevel.Admin, "Set privilege levels", "/plvl <level> <player>")]

// Database
[CmdAttribute("&save", ePrivLevel.Admin, "Save database", "/save")]
[CmdAttribute("&refresh", ePrivLevel.Admin, "Refresh cache", "/refresh <module>")]

// Development
[CmdAttribute("&code", ePrivLevel.Admin, "Execute code", "/code <expression>")]
[CmdAttribute("&benchmark", ePrivLevel.Admin, "Run benchmarks", "/benchmark <test>")]
```

## Single Permission System

### Individual Command Access

**Game Rule Summary**: Sometimes specific players need access to individual commands without getting full GM or Admin privileges. The permission system allows granting single commands to specific players. For example, a player might get access to `/broadcast` for special events without getting all Admin powers.

```csharp
public class SinglePermission
{
    // Check if player has specific command permission
    public static bool HasPermission(GamePlayer player, string command)
    {
        var permission = DOLDB<DbSinglePermission>.SelectObject(
            DB.Column("PlayerID").IsEqualTo(player.InternalID)
              .And(DB.Column("Command").IsEqualTo(command))
        );
        return permission != null;
    }
    
    // Grant command permission to player
    public static void addPermission(GamePlayer player, string command)
    {
        var permission = new DbSinglePermission();
        permission.PlayerID = player.InternalID;
        permission.Command = command;
        GameServer.Database.AddObject(permission);
    }
    
    // Remove command permission
    public static void removePermission(GamePlayer player, string command)
    {
        var permission = DOLDB<DbSinglePermission>.SelectObject(
            DB.Column("PlayerID").IsEqualTo(player.InternalID)
              .And(DB.Column("Command").IsEqualTo(command))
        );
        if (permission != null)
            GameServer.Database.DeleteObject(permission);
    }
}
```

### Account-Wide Permissions

**Game Rule Summary**: Permissions can be granted to entire accounts rather than individual characters. This means if you have permission to use a command, all your characters on that account can use it. This is convenient for players who have multiple characters but need the same special permissions.

```csharp
public static void addPermissionAccount(GamePlayer player, string command)
{
    var permission = new DbSinglePermission();
    permission.PlayerID = player.Client.Account.ObjectId;
    permission.Command = command;
    permission.Type = 1; // Account-wide flag
    GameServer.Database.AddObject(permission);
}
```

## Help System

### Command Help

**Game Rule Summary**: You can get help with any command by typing `/cmdhelp` to see all available commands, or `/cmdhelp <command>` to get detailed help for a specific command. The help system only shows you commands you actually have permission to use, so you won't see GM commands if you're a regular player.

```csharp
[CmdAttribute("&cmdhelp", ePrivLevel.Player, "Show command help", "/cmdhelp [command]")]
public class CmdHelpCommandHandler : AbstractCommandHandler, ICommandHandler
{
    public void OnCommand(GameClient client, string[] args)
    {
        ePrivLevel privilegeLevel = (ePrivLevel)client.Account.PrivLevel;
        
        if (args.Length == 1)
        {
            ShowUseableCommands(client);
            return;
        }
        
        string commandArg = args[1];
        if (commandArg[0] != '/')
            commandArg = $"/{commandArg}";
            
        GameCommand gameCommand = ScriptMgr.GetCommand($"&{commandArg[1..]}");
        
        if (gameCommand == null || (ePrivLevel)gameCommand.m_lvl > privilegeLevel)
        {
            DisplayMessage(client, $"No such command ({commandArg})");
            return;
        }
        
        DisplayMessage(client, $"Usage for {commandArg}:");
        foreach (string usage in gameCommand.Usage)
            DisplayMessage(client, usage);
    }
}
```

### Syntax Display

**Game Rule Summary**: Every command includes built-in help that shows you the correct syntax and examples of how to use it. If you use a command incorrectly, it will often show you the proper format automatically.

```csharp
public virtual void DisplaySyntax(GameClient client)
{
    if (client == null || !client.IsPlaying)
        return;
        
    // Get command info for this handler
    var cmdAttrib = GetType().GetCustomAttribute<CmdAttribute>();
    if (cmdAttrib != null)
    {
        DisplayMessage(client, $"Syntax for {cmdAttrib.Cmd}:");
        foreach (string usage in cmdAttrib.Usage)
            DisplayMessage(client, usage);
    }
}
```

## Localization Support

### Translated Commands

**Game Rule Summary**: The command system supports multiple languages. Command descriptions and help text can be translated into different languages based on your account settings. This makes the game more accessible to international players who might not speak English as their primary language.

```csharp
[CmdAttribute("&advice", new[] {"&adv"}, ePrivLevel.Player,
    "PLCommands.Advice.Description",     // Translation key
    "PLCommands.Advice.Syntax.AdvChannel",
    "PLCommands.Advice.Syntax.Advice")]
public class AdviceCommandHandler : AbstractCommandHandler, ICommandHandler
{
    public void OnCommand(GameClient client, string[] args)
    {
        // Use LanguageMgr for localized messages
        string message = LanguageMgr.GetTranslation(client.Account.Language, 
            "PLCommands.Advice.Msg.Welcome");
        DisplayMessage(client, message);
    }
}
```

### Language Files

**Game Rule Summary**: All command text is stored in language files that can be translated. When you see command help or error messages, they're pulled from these files in your preferred language. This system allows the game to support multiple languages without changing the core code.

```ini
# EN/Commands/PlayerCommands.txt
PLCommands.Advice.Description = Lists all flagged Advisors, sends questions, and messages advice channel.
PLCommands.Advice.Syntax.AdvChannel = /adv <message> - Sends message to advice channel
PLCommands.Advice.Msg.Welcome = Welcome to the advice system!
```

## Error Handling

### Command Not Found

**Game Rule Summary**: If you type a command that doesn't exist, the game will tell you "No such command" rather than trying to guess what you meant. This prevents confusion and makes it clear when you've made a typo or tried to use a command that doesn't exist.

```csharp
if (!ScriptMgr.HandleCommand(client, cmdLine))
{
    if (cmdLine[0] == '&')
        cmdLine = "/" + cmdLine.Remove(0, 1);
    client.Out.SendMessage($"No such command ({cmdLine})", 
        eChatType.CT_System, eChatLoc.CL_SystemWindow);
}
```

### Permission Denied

**Game Rule Summary**: If you try to use a command you don't have permission for, the game responds as if the command doesn't exist. This security feature prevents players from discovering what admin commands are available by trying them all. Only commands you can actually use will show up in help or error messages.

```csharp
if (client.Account.PrivLevel < myCommand.m_lvl)
{
    if (!SinglePermission.HasPermission(client.Player, commandName))
    {
        client.Out.SendMessage("No such command (" + pars[0] + ")", 
            eChatType.CT_System, eChatLoc.CL_SystemWindow);
        return true;
    }
}
```

### Exception Handling
```csharp
try
{
    ExecuteCommand(client, myCommand, pars);
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    if (log.IsErrorEnabled)
        log.Error("HandleCommand", e);
        
    DisplayMessage(client, "An error occurred while executing the command.");
}
```

## Command Logging

### Audit Trail
All GM and Admin commands are logged:

```csharp
if (client.Account == null || 
    ((ServerProperties.Properties.LOG_ALL_GM_COMMANDS && client.Account.PrivLevel > 1) || 
     myCommand.m_lvl > 1))
{
    string commandText = String.Join(" ", pars);
    string targetName = client.Player?.TargetObject?.Name ?? "(no target)";
    string playerName = client.Player?.Name ?? "(player is null)";
    string accountName = client.Account?.Name ?? "account is null";
    
    log.Info($"GM/Admin Command: {commandText} by {playerName}({accountName}) target: {targetName}");
    AuditMgr.LogGMCommand(commandText, playerName, targetName, accountName);
}
```

### Database Logging
```csharp
public class AuditMgr
{
    public static void LogGMCommand(string command, string playerName, string targetName, string accountName)
    {
        var auditEntry = new DbAuditEntry();
        auditEntry.AuditType = "GMCommand";
        auditEntry.PlayerName = playerName;
        auditEntry.AccountName = accountName;
        auditEntry.TargetName = targetName;
        auditEntry.Command = command;
        auditEntry.TimeStamp = DateTime.Now;
        
        GameServer.Database.AddObject(auditEntry);
    }
}
```

## Configuration

### Server Properties
```ini
# Command system settings
COMMAND_SPAM_DELAY = 500              # Default command spam delay (ms)
LOG_ALL_GM_COMMANDS = true            # Log all GM/Admin commands
DISABLE_APPEALSYSTEM = false          # Enable/disable appeal system

# Chat settings
ANON_MODIFIER = 1                     # Anonymous mode: -1=disabled, 0=default off, 1=default on
ADVICE_SLOWMODE_LENGTH = 30           # Advice channel slowmode (seconds)
```

## Performance Considerations

### Command Caching
Commands are cached after initial loading for fast lookup:

```csharp
private static readonly Dictionary<string, GameCommand> m_gameCommands = new Dictionary<string, GameCommand>();
```

### Memory Management
- Command handlers are instantiated once and reused
- Temporary properties are used for spam tracking
- Weak references prevent memory leaks

### Threading
- Commands execute on the game thread
- Thread-safe collections used for command storage
- Lock-free operations where possible

## Test Scenarios

### Basic Command Execution
```csharp
// Given: Player with appropriate privilege level
// When: Valid command is entered
// Then: Command executes successfully
```

### Permission Enforcement
```csharp
// Given: Player without sufficient privilege level
// When: Restricted command is entered
// Then: "No such command" message is displayed
```

### Spam Protection
```csharp
// Given: Player enters command rapidly
// When: Commands are sent faster than spam delay
// Then: Subsequent commands are ignored
```

### Single Permission System
```csharp
// Given: Player granted specific command permission
// When: Command is entered despite insufficient privilege level
// Then: Command executes successfully
```

## Integration Points

### Chat System
Commands are processed through the chat packet handler

### Permission System
Integrates with account privilege levels and single permissions

### Audit System
All privileged commands are logged for security

### Event System
Commands can trigger events for cross-system integration

### Localization System
Command text and messages support multiple languages
