# OpenDAoC System Reference Document (SRD)

## Overview

Welcome to the **OpenDAoC System Reference Document (SRD)** - the definitive, authoritative reference for all Dark Age of Camelot game mechanics, rules, and systems. This living document serves as the single source of truth for authentic DAoC gameplay implementation.

## Purpose

The SRD ensures that OpenDAoC preserves the authentic Dark Age of Camelot experience by providing:

- **Exact game mechanics** with mathematical formulas and edge cases
- **Implementation guidance** for developers coding these systems  
- **Test specifications** for validating correct behavior
- **Cross-system interactions** to understand complex dependencies
- **Performance requirements** for server stability

## Quick Start

### For Developers
1. **Implementing a feature?** Check the relevant SRD section first
2. **Found missing info?** Research and update the SRD as part of your work
3. **Discovered new mechanics?** Document them following the SRD template
4. **Need test cases?** Use the SRD test scenarios as your starting point

### For Testers
1. **Writing tests?** Reference SRD specifications for expected behavior
2. **Found discrepancies?** Check if SRD needs updating or code needs fixing
3. **Testing edge cases?** SRD documents known edge cases and special conditions

### For Contributors
1. **Community research?** Contributions to SRD are highly valued
2. **Rules clarification?** Submit updates with your sources and verification
3. **Implementation feedback?** Help improve SRD based on practical experience

### Document Template

Each SRD document follows a standardized template:

- **Document Status**: Completeness, verification status, implementation status
- **Overview**: System purpose and role in DAoC
- **Core Mechanics**: Detailed formulas, sources, requirements, edge cases
- **System Interactions**: How this system affects/is affected by others
- **Implementation Notes**: Performance, architecture, common pitfalls
- **Test Scenarios**: Specific test cases for validation
- **Change Log**: Track all updates and modifications
- **References**: Sources, documentation, implementation links

## How to Use This SRD

### Reading SRD Documents

Each document provides multiple levels of detail:

1. **Overview** - Quick understanding of the system
2. **Core Mechanics** - Implementation-ready specifications  
3. **Edge Cases** - Special conditions and exceptions
4. **Test Scenarios** - Validation requirements
5. **References** - Additional information sources

### Updating SRD Documents

#### When to Update
- **New rule discovery** - Found previously unknown mechanic
- **Rule clarification** - Existing rule needs correction/completion
- **Gap identification** - Missing information identified
- **Implementation feedback** - Code reveals new details or edge cases

#### Update Process
1. Research and verify the information
2. Update the appropriate SRD section
3. Add detailed change log entry
4. Update affected test scenarios
5. Review cross-system impacts
6. Commit with "SRD:" prefix

### Example SRD Usage

#### For Implementation
```csharp
// Developer implementing attack resolution
// References: SRD/01_Combat_Systems/Attack_Resolution.md

public AttackResult ProcessAttack(IAttacker attacker, IDefender defender, AttackContext context)
{
    // SRD Section: Attack Resolution Order
    if (CheckIntercept(attacker, defender)) return AttackResult.Intercepted;
    if (CheckEvade(defender, context.AttackerCount)) return AttackResult.Evaded;
    if (CheckParry(defender, attacker.Weapon)) return AttackResult.Parried;
    // ... continue following SRD specification
}
```

#### For Testing
```csharp
// Tester validating implementation
// References: SRD/01_Combat_Systems/Attack_Resolution.md - Test Scenario 3

[Test]
public void AttackResolution_ShouldCheckEvadeBeforeParry_WhenBothAvailable()
{
    // Test validates SRD Attack Resolution Order specification
    // Expected: Evade checked first, parry only if evade fails
}
```

## Quality Standards

### Documentation Requirements
