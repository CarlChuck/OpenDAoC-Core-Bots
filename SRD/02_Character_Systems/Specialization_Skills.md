# Specialization and Skills

## Document Status
- **Last Updated**: 2024-01-20
- **Verification**: Code-verified from GamePlayer.cs and Specialization.cs
- **Implementation Status**: âœ… Fully Implemented

## Overview
Specializations are trainable skill lines that define a character's combat abilities, spells, and styles. Players allocate specialization points gained through leveling to increase their effectiveness in chosen areas.

## Core Mechanics

### Specialization Points

#### Point Formula
```
Levels 1-5:  Level points per level (1+2+3+4+5 = 15 total)
Levels 6+:   Level * SpecPointsMultiplier / 10 per level
Level 40.5:  Level * SpecPointsMultiplier / 20 (half-level bonus)
```

#### Standard Multipliers by Class Type
- **Base Classes**: 10 (1.0x level)
- **Pure Casters**: 10 (1.0x level)
- **Hybrids**: 15-20 (1.5-2.0x level)
- **Pure Melee**: 20 (2.0x level)

**Source**: `CharacterClassBase.cs:SpecPointsMultiplier`

#### Total Points Available
At level 50 with standard multiplier (10):
- Base: 15 + (6-50) * 1.0 = 15 + 45 = 60
- Plus half-level at 40: +2 = 62 total
- Hybrids (1.5x): ~77 points
- Pure melee (2.0x): ~95 points

### Specialization Training

#### Training Requirements
- Cannot train above character level
- Costs = current level + 1 points
- Must have sufficient points available

#### Point Cost Formula
```csharp
Cost = SpecLevel + 1
// Example: Training from 0->1 costs 1 point
//          Training from 49->50 costs 50 points
```

#### Total Cost to Max
```
Total = (Level * (Level + 1) - 2) / 2
// Level 50: (50 * 51 - 2) / 2 = 1274 points
```

### Autotrain System

#### Autotrain Levels
```
AutotrainLevel = PlayerLevel / 4 (rounded down)
```

#### Autotrain Points
Free points up to autotrain level:
```csharp
if (spec.Level < max_autotrain)
    FreePoints = ((max_autotrain * (max_autotrain + 1) - 2) / 2) - 
                 ((spec.Level * (spec.Level + 1) - 2) / 2);
```

**Source**: `GamePlayer.cs:GetAutoTrainPoints()`

### Modified Spec Level

#### Calculation
```csharp
ModifiedLevel = BaseLevel + ItemBonus + RealmAbilityBonus
```

#### Special Cases
- Champion lines: Always 50
- Realm spell lines: Equal to player level
- Career specializations: Equal to player level

**Source**: `GamePlayer.cs:GetModifiedSpecLevel()`

### Specialization Types

#### Trainable Specializations
- Standard weapon/magic skills
- Can be trained with points
- Saved in database
- Examples: Slash, Fire Magic, Stealth

#### Untrainable Specializations
- Granted by class/level
- Cannot be trained
- Examples: Some racial abilities

#### Career Specializations
- Level-based progression
- Not saved in database
- Auto-scale with level
- Examples: Some ML abilities

### Skill Acquisition

#### Abilities
Granted at specific spec levels:
```csharp
foreach (Ability ab in spec.GetAbilitiesForLiving(this))
{
    if (!HasAbility(ab.KeyName) || GetAbility(ab.KeyName).Level < ab.Level)
        AddAbility(ab, sendMessages);
}
```

#### Styles
Combat styles learned through specialization:
```csharp
foreach (Style st in spec.GetStylesForLiving(this))
{
    styleComponent.AddStyle(st, sendMessages);
}
```

#### Spell Lines
Magic users gain spell lines:
```csharp
foreach (SpellLine sl in spec.GetSpellLinesForLiving(this))
{
    AddSpellLine(sl, sendMessages);
}
```

## System Interactions

### With Level System
- Spec points gained on level up
- Cannot train above character level
- Autotrain scales with level/4

### With Class System
- Classes define spec multiplier
- Class determines available specs
- Some specs class-restricted

### With Item System
- Items can boost spec levels
- Spec requirements for items
- Skill bonuses from gear

### With Combat System
- Weapon skill based on spec
- Style availability from spec
- Damage bonuses from specialization

## Implementation Notes

### Database Storage
```sql
DOLCharacters_specs table:
- DOLCharacters_ID (character reference)
- SpecName (specialization key)
- SpecLevel (trained level)
```

### Spec Keys
Common spec keys defined in `Specs.cs`:
- Weapon: Slash, Thrust, Crush, Polearm
- Magic: Fire_Magic, Ice_Magic, Earth_Magic
- Stealth: Stealth, Critical_Strike
- Archery: Archery, RecurveBow, CompositeBow

### Training Methods
1. **Trainer Window** (1.105+): `SendTrainerWindow()`
2. **Command**: `/train <spec> <level>`
3. **Programmatic**: `AddSpecialization()`

## Test Scenarios

### Basic Training Test
```
Given: Level 10 character with 10 points
Action: Train Slash from 0 to 5
Cost: 1+2+3+4+5 = 15 points
Result: Insufficient points (need 15, have 10)
```

### Autotrain Test
```
Given: Level 20 character, Slash autotrain spec
Autotrain: 20/4 = 5 levels free
Action: Train Slash to 5
Cost: 0 (covered by autotrain)
```

### Modified Level Test
```
Given: Base Slash 45, +5 from items
ModifiedLevel: 50
Result: Full weapon skill effectiveness
```

### Respec Cost Test
```
Given: Slash at level 30
Respec points: (30*31-2)/2 = 464
Minus autotrain: 464 - autotrain points
```
