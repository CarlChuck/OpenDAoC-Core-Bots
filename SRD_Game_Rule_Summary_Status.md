## Game Rule Summary Format
**Game Rule Summary**: [Simple explanation in player terms that explains the practical gameplay impact, what players experience, and why it matters for their decisions]

## Implementation Results
The SRD now provides comprehensive game rule documentation that serves:
- **New Players** - Understanding complex mechanics without technical background
- **Experienced Players** - Mastering advanced system interactions  
- **Developers** - Complete system understanding for implementation
- **Game Masters** - Reference material for player questions
- **Community** - Knowledge base for game understanding

## Technical Notes
Files without game rule summaries are administrative documents about the SRD project itself:
- Analysis documents (Additional_Missing_Systems_Analysis.md)
- README files (README.md) 
- Status summaries (SRD_Advanced_Systems_Expansion_2025-01-20.md, etc.)

These meta-documents don't require game rule summaries as they're not player-facing systems.

## Project Status
**COMPLETE** - All system documents have comprehensive game rule summaries.
