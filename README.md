## üéØ Refactoring Goals

### Architecture Transformation
- **Clean Architecture**: Proper layer separation with zero violations
- **Dependency Injection**: 100% DI coverage, eliminate static dependencies  
- **Interface-First Design**: 95%+ interface coverage for all public APIs
- **Performance**: <0.5ms combat calculations, zero-allocation hot paths

### Scalability Targets
- **Single Server**: 2,000 concurrent players
- **Distributed**: 10,000+ concurrent players
- **Zero Downtime**: Gradual migration with feature flags

### Quality Standards
- **Test Coverage**: 90%+ for business logic
- **Code Complexity**: <7 cyclomatic complexity average
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive architecture and implementation docs

## üìã Current Phase Details

### ‚úÖ Week 1: DI Infrastructure Setup (COMPLETE)
- Dependency injection container setup
- Service lifetime management
- Legacy adapter patterns
- Performance-optimized factories

### ‚úÖ Week 2: Interface Extraction (COMPLETE)  
- Complete interface hierarchy (IGameObject, IGameLiving, ICharacter)
- Interface segregation principle compliance
- Adapter pattern implementations
- Unit tests and dependency validation

### üîÑ Week 3: Layer Architecture Setup (IN PROGRESS)
- Physical layer separation (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation)
- Dependency rule enforcement
- Cross-layer mapping infrastructure
- Use case interfaces and repository patterns

## üìà Quality Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Interface Coverage | ~15% | 95% | üî¥ In Progress |
| DI Coverage | ~5% | 100% | üî¥ In Progress |
| Layer Violations | Many | 0 | üî¥ Not Started |
| Static Dependencies | 1,000+ | 0 | üî¥ In Progress |
| Test Coverage | ~10% | 90% | üî¥ In Progress |

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### For Contributors
1. **Check Progress Tracker** - Always start with the [Progress Tracker](Helper%20Docs/OpenDAoC_Refactoring_Progress_Tracker.md)
2. **Follow Standards** - Adhere to [Development Standards v3](Helper%20Docs/OpenDAoC_Development_Standards_v3.mdc)
3. **Interface-First** - Design interfaces before implementations
4. **Test-Driven** - Write tests first, aim for 90%+ coverage
5. **Update Documentation** - Keep progress tracker and docs current

### Branch Strategy

## About OpenDAoC

OpenDAoC is an emulator for Dark Age of Camelot (DAoC) servers, originally a fork of the [DOLSharp](https://github.com/Dawn-of-Light/DOLSharp) project.

Now undergoing a complete architectural transformation with ECS architecture and clean architecture principles, OpenDAoC ensures performance and scalability for thousands of players, providing a robust platform for creating and managing DAoC servers.

While the project focuses on recreating the DAoC 1.65 experience, it can be adapted for any patch level.

## Documentation

The easiest way to get started with OpenDAoC is to use Docker. Check out the `docker-compose.yml` file in the repository root for an example setup.

For detailed instructions and additional setup options, refer to the full [OpenDAoC Documentation](https://www.opendaoc.com/docs/).

## Releases

Releases for OpenDAoC are available at [OpenDAoC Releases](https://github.com/OpenDAoC/OpenDAoC-Core/releases).

OpenDAoC is also available as a Docker image, which can be pulled from the following registries:

- [GitHub Container Registry](https://ghcr.io/opendaoc/opendaoc-core) (recommended): `ghcr.io/opendaoc/opendaoc-core/opendaoc:latest`
- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/claitz/opendaoc/): `claitz/opendaoc:latest`

For detailed instructions and additional setup options, refer to the documentation.
