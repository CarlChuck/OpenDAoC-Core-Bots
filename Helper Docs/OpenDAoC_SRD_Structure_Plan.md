# OpenDAoC System Reference Document (SRD) - Structure and Maintenance Plan

## Overview

The OpenDAoC System Reference Document (SRD) serves as the **definitive, authoritative reference** for all Dark Age of Camelot game mechanics, rules, and systems. This living document ensures authentic DAoC gameplay implementation and serves as the primary source for developers, testers, and contributors.

## SRD Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Authoritative Reference**: Single source of truth for all DAoC game mechanics
2. **Living Documentation**: Continuously updated as new rules are discovered or clarified
3. **Implementation Guide**: Detailed enough to guide accurate code implementation
4. **Testing Foundation**: Provides exact specifications for test validation
5. **Completeness**: Covers all systems from combat to crafting to social mechanics

### Success Metrics
- **Completeness**: All major game systems documented with formulas and edge cases
- **Accuracy**: All documented rules match authentic live DAoC behavior
- **Usability**: Developers can implement features directly from SRD specifications
- **Currency**: Document reflects latest discoveries and clarifications

## Maintenance Workflow

### When to Update the SRD

#### 1. New Rule Discovery
```
Trigger: Developer/tester discovers previously unknown mechanic
Process:
1. Document the discovery in appropriate SRD section
2. Add source of discovery (testing, player report, code analysis)
3. Create test cases to validate the rule
4. Update implementation if needed
5. Mark document section as "Recently Updated"
```

#### 2. Rule Clarification
```
Trigger: Existing rule found to be incomplete or inaccurate
Process:
1. Update the affected SRD section with correct information
2. Add note about what was corrected
3. Update any affected test cases
4. Review related systems for similar issues
5. Update implementation to match corrected rule
```

#### 3. Gap Identification
```
Trigger: Developer needs rule information that's not documented
Process:
1. Research the missing rule through testing/analysis
2. Add new section to appropriate SRD document
3. Mark as "Needs Verification" if uncertain
4. Create issue for community verification if needed
5. Implement based on best available information
```

#### 4. Implementation Feedback
```
Trigger: Code implementation reveals rule complexity or edge cases
Process:
1. Update SRD with implementation-discovered details
2. Add performance notes if relevant
3. Document any compromises made for technical reasons
4. Update test requirements based on implementation experience
```

### Update Process

#### For Major Changes
1. **Research Phase**
   - Verify rule against multiple sources
   - Test on live servers if possible
   - Consult community experts

2. **Documentation Phase**
   - Update relevant SRD sections

## Conclusion

The OpenDAoC SRD serves as the foundation for authentic DAoC implementation. By maintaining it as a living document with clear update processes, we ensure that our emulator preserves the authentic DAoC experience while enabling confident development and refactoring.

**Key Principles**:
- **Accuracy over speed**: Take time to verify rules correctly
- **Completeness over perfection**: Document what we know, mark gaps clearly
- **Community collaboration**: Leverage collective DAoC knowledge
- **Implementation focus**: Write for developers who need to code these systems

**Remember**: The SRD is not just documentation—it's the blueprint for preserving DAoC's authentic gameplay for future generations of players.
