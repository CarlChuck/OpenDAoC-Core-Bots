# OpenDAoC Core Systems - Unit Testing Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive unit testing approach for the OpenDAoC core systems refactoring project. The tests are designed to ensure all game mechanics work according to the documented rules while enabling safe refactoring through interface-first design.

## Test Coverage

### 1. Combat System Tests (`Combat/CombatSystemTests.cs`)

**Purpose**: Verify all combat mechanics work according to game rules

**Key Test Areas**:
- **Attack Resolution Order**: Tests that defenses are checked in correct order (Intercept → Evade → Parry → Block → Guard → Hit/Miss → Bladeturn)
- **Hit/Miss Calculations**: 
  - Base 18% miss chance (patch 1.117C)
  - Level difference modifiers (±1.33% per level in PvE)
  - Multiple attacker reductions (-0.5% per additional attacker)
  - Ammo modifiers (Rough +15%, Footed -25%)
- **Damage Calculations**:
  - Base damage formula with slow weapon modifier
  - Weapon skill calculations with specialization variance
  - Armor factor damage reduction
  - Critical hit minimum 10% damage
- **Defense Mechanics**:
  - Evade formula: `((Dex + Qui) / 2 - 50) * 0.05 + EvadeAbilityLevel * 5`
  - Parry formula: `(Dex * 2 - 100) / 40 + ParrySpec / 2 + MasteryOfParry * 3 + 5`
  - Block scaling with shield spec and size
- **Style Combat**: Positional requirements, opening conditions, endurance costs
- **Spell Damage**: Stat modifiers, hit chance, variance with Mastery of Magic

### 2. Character Progression Tests (`Character/CharacterProgressionTests.cs`)

**Purpose**: Ensure character advancement mechanics are correct

**Key Test Areas**:
- **Experience System**:
  - Level progression with increasing XP requirements
  - Group bonuses (solo to 8-player scaling)
  - Camp bonuses for repeated kills
- **Stat Progression**:
  - Primary stat: +1 per level from 6+
  - Secondary stat: +1 every 2 levels from 6+
  - Tertiary stat: +1 every 3 levels from 6+
- **Specialization Points**:
  - Formula: `Level * SpecMultiplier / 10`
  - Total at 50 with multiplier 20: 2550 points
  - Realm rank bonus points included
- **Champion Levels**:
  - Only available at level 50
  - Triangular progression (1, 3, 6, 10... points)
  - Class-specific abilities unlock
- **Realm Ranks**:
  - Points to rank conversion
  - Ability points per rank
  - RR5 special ability unlock
  - Bonus HP scaling

### 3. Item System Tests (`Items/ItemSystemTests.cs`)

**Purpose**: Validate item mechanics and equipment rules

**Key Test Areas**:
- **Item Properties**:
  - Quality affects effectiveness (85-100%)
  - Condition degrades over time
  - Durability sets max condition
- **Bonus System**:
  - Level-based caps (0 at L1-14, 35 at L45+)
  - Additive stacking with caps
  - Property-specific caps (HP, resists, etc.)
- **Equipment Slots**:
  - Slot restrictions and validation
  - Two-handed weapon blocking both hands
  - Multiple ring/bracer slots
- **Item Generation**:
  - Random item creation with valid stats
  - ROG (Random Object Generator) modifiers
  - Unique items with special properties
  - Artifact leveling system
  - Crafted item quality (94-100 for skilled crafters)

### 4. Property Calculator Tests (`PropertyCalculators/PropertyCalculatorTests.cs`)

**Purpose**: Test the modular property calculation system

**Key Test Areas**:
- **Calculator Types**:
  - Armor Factor: Base + Items + Buffs - Debuffs
  - Resistances: Capped at 70%
  - Stats: Debuffs halved, special modifiers
  - Speed: Multiplicative stacking with diminishing returns
- **Stacking Rules**:
  - Buffs: Highest per category wins
  - Items: Fully additive
  - Debuffs: Subtractive (halved for stats)
- **Special Cases**:
  - Constitution lost at death
  - Casting speed capped at 50%
  - Critical hit capped at 50%
  - Power regen minimum 0
- **Multiplicative Modifiers**:
  - Damage bonuses stack multiplicatively
  - Realm bonuses apply additively

## Testing Patterns

### 1. Interface-First Approach
```csharp
// All tests use interfaces, not implementations
private Mock<IAttacker> CreateMockAttacker(int level = 50) { }
private Mock<IWeapon> CreateMockWeapon(int dps = 165) { }
```

### 2. Parameterized Testing
```csharp
[TestCase(1, 0)]    // Level 1-14: no bonuses
[TestCase(15, 5)]   // Level 15-19: 5 cap
[TestCase(45, 35)]  // Level 45+: 35 cap
public void BonusCaps_ShouldScaleWithLevel(int level, int expectedCap) { }
```

### 3. Clear Test Structure
- **Arrange**: Set up test data and mocks
- **Act**: Execute the system under test
- **Assert**: Verify expected behavior with FluentAssertions

### 4. Formula Documentation
```csharp
// Base Evade = ((Dex + Qui) / 2 - 50) * 0.05 + EvadeAbilityLevel * 5
// = ((100 + 80) / 2 - 50) * 0.05 + 3 * 5
// = (90 - 50) * 0.05 + 15 = 2 + 15 = 17%
evadeChance.Should().Be(0.17);
```

## Benefits of This Approach

### 1. **Comprehensive Coverage**
- All major game systems have test coverage
- Edge cases and boundaries are tested
- Formulas are verified against documentation

### 2. **Refactoring Safety**
- Tests verify behavior, not implementation
- Interface-based design allows easy mocking
- Changes can be made with confidence

### 3. **Documentation**
- Tests serve as living documentation
- Formulas are clearly commented
- Expected behavior is explicit

### 4. **Maintainability**
- Clear test organization by system
- Reusable mock helpers
- Consistent patterns across all tests

## Integration with Development

### During Refactoring
1. Run tests before making changes
2. Refactor implementation
3. Ensure all tests still pass
4. Add new tests for new functionality

### Code Review Process
- All changes must have test coverage
- Tests must pass in CI/CD pipeline
- Coverage reports show untested code

### Performance Validation
- Benchmark critical paths
- Compare before/after refactoring
- Ensure no performance regressions

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. Complete remaining system tests (Guild, Housing, Crafting, Quests)
2. Add integration tests between systems
3. Set up continuous integration pipeline
4. Generate coverage reports

### Long-term Goals
1. Performance benchmarking suite
2. Automated regression detection
3. Test data generation tools
4. Full end-to-end testing

## Conclusion

This comprehensive unit testing approach provides a solid foundation for refactoring the OpenDAoC core systems. By testing against documented game rules using interface-first design, the project can evolve safely while maintaining the authentic DAoC experience players expect.

The tests not only verify correctness but also serve as documentation and examples for future developers. With this testing framework in place, the refactoring effort can proceed with confidence, knowing that any breaking changes will be immediately detected.
